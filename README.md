TeX<3 by Thomas Eriksson
=========================

What?
-----
TeX<3 is a monospace conversion of lmroman10-regular.otf originally by Donald Knuth and his minions of voloneers.
It's a pleasure to read due to professional hinting and very accent serifs.

Why?
----
I stare at text on a computer every day.
Recently I've become fond of the "Century Schoolbook Mono", by Bitstream.
This font, however is non-free, lacks a few glyphs and is not very well hinted.
Enter the wonderful Computer Modern originally by Donald Knuth and his minions of volonteers who has produced an amazing typeface which is a pleasure to read.
Only some minor re-assembly was required to make it monospace.
Horray! A free programming font with great hinting!

How?
----
Some resizing of glyphs in FontForge:
* The width of lowercase letters were preserved, with the exception of w and m, since these were very wide.
* The width of UPPERCASE letters were scaled down to 73% to make them fit the lowercase letters in width.
* some symbols and the letter "W" was also resized.

I still haven't resized all funky letters with accents, but I welcome contributions of these :)

Spread the TeX <3!
